<h4>Overview</h4>
<div><span id="internal-source-marker_0.8252136884257197">Last week, Hannon Hill released the latest version of its flagship WCM product</span>&#160;<a href="http://www.hannonhill.com/kb/Release-Notes/6.10/index.html#release-summary"><span>Cascade 6.10</span></a>&#160;<span>with features targeted at all 3 types of users in Cascade: content contributors (end-users), developers, and administrators. We&#8217;re proud to say this release satisfied</span>&#160;<a href="http://ideas.hannonhill.com/forums/52559-cascade-ideas/"><span>121 votes on our user Idea Exchange</span></a><span>! &#160;Highlights include:</span></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span>a Facebook Connector</span></li>
<li><span>new tools for Velocity developers</span></li>
<li><span>a filter box to quickly locate Users, Groups, and Roles</span></li>
<li><span>a handy feature for linking between assets published to different web servers</span></li>
</ul>
<span>Below you will find more in-depth information on a few of the exciting new features in this release. &#160;</span><br />
<br />
<h4 dir="ltr">Facebook</h4>
<div><span>The</span>&#160;<a href="http://www.hannonhill.com/kb/Facebook-Connector/index.html"><span>Facebook Connector</span></a>&#160;<span>allows end-users to automatically share information about newly published content to a Facebook page. It is based on our</span>&#160;<a href="http://www.hannonhill.com/kb/Twitter-Connector/index.html"><span>Twitter Connector</span></a>&#160;<span>-- initially</span>&#160;<a href="http://www.hannonhill.com/kb/Release-Notes/6.4/index.html#available-connector-types-in-64"><span>released in 6.4</span></a>&#160;<span>-- and is part of our continued effort to leverage popular Social Media tools to engage your audience through a variety of channels.</span></div>

<br />
<h4 dir="ltr"><span>Increase your Velocity!</span></h4>
<span>&#160;</span><br />
<span>For Cascade developers, we&#8217;ve upgraded</span>&#160;<a href="http://velocity.apache.org/engine/"><span>our Velocity engine</span></a>&#160;<span>to version 1.7 and added a number of new tools for developers including:</span><br />
<ul>
<li><span><a href="http://www.hannonhill.com/kb/Script-Formats/index.html#escape-tool">Escape Tool</a></span></li>
<li><span><a href="http://www.hannonhill.com/kb/Script-Formats/index.html#math-tool">Math Tool</a></span></li>
<li><span><a href="http://www.hannonhill.com/kb/Script-Formats/index.html#display-tool">Display Tool</a></span></li>
<li><span><a href="http://www.hannonhill.com/kb/Script-Formats/index.html#number-tool">Number Tool</a></span></li>
</ul>
<span>The goal is to allow developers to do more with less code. Here&#8217;s great example of how the Display Tool&#8217;s list() function can aid developers in outputting list or array contents more easily.</span><br />
<span>&#160;</span><br />
<span>Before 6.10:</span><span>&#160;</span><br />
<span>&#160;</span><br />
<span>#set ($links = [&#8220;link1&#8221;, &#8220;link2&#8221;, &#8220;link3&#8221;])</span><br />
<span>#foreach ($link in $links)</span><br />
<span>#if ($velocityCount == $links.size)</span><br />
<span>$link</span><br />
<span>#else</span><br />
<span>$link |</span><br />
<span>#end</span><br />
<span>#end</span><span>&#160;</span><br />
<span>&#160;</span><br />
<span>In 6.10:</span><br />
<span>&#160;</span><br />
<span>#set ($links = [&#8220;link1&#8221;, &#8220;link2&#8221;, &#8220;link3&#8221;])</span><br />
<span>$_DisplayTool.list($links, &#8220; | &#8221;)</span><br />
<span>&#160;</span><br />
<span>Other notable improvements to Velocity include:</span> 
<ul>
<li><span>Support for #break directives inside of #foreach loops</span></li>
<li><span>Ability to treat arrays as Lists</span></li>
<li><span>Better support for variable scoping inside of #foreach loops and macros</span></li>
<li><span>$foreach.count, $foreach.first, $foreach.last, $foreach.hasNext loop variables</span></li>
</ul>
<span>&#160;</span><br />
<span>Check out our</span>&#160;<a href="http://www.hannonhill.com/kb/Script-Formats/index.html#velocity-example"><span>Script Formats documentation</span></a>&#160;<span>for examples of each of the new tools.</span><br />
<span>&#160;</span><br />
<span>Also, join us for our</span>&#160;<a href="http://goo.gl/mzyHw"><span>upcoming Velocity webinar</span></a>&#160;<span>this Tuesday to learn more about the improvements available in 6.10.</span><br />
<br />
<h4 dir="ltr"><span>Locate Users, Groups, and Roles faster</span></h4>
<span>&#160;</span><br />
<span>Administrator users let us know that</span>&#160;<a href="http://ideas.hannonhill.com/forums/52559-cascade-ideas/suggestions/679645-search-extension-for-users-and-groups?ref=title"><span>looking for Users, Groups, and Roles was becoming unwieldy</span></a>&#160;<span>with enough of them in the system. In 6.10, we added a filter box to the users, groups, and roles interface to allow you to locate these objects by name (or full name or email for users). We also added &#8220;Full Name&#8221; and &#8220;Email&#8221; columns to the Users table.</span><br />
<br />
<img alt="Users, Groups, and Roles Filtering" height="186" src="http://hannonhill.com/news/blog/2011/users-groups-roles-filter.png" width="597" /><br />
<br />
<h4 dir="ltr"><span>Destination Web URLs and Mobile Outputs</span></h4>
<span>&#160;</span><br />
<span>In Cascade 6.8, we added the ability to publish</span>&#160;<a href="http://www.hannonhill.com/kb/Release-Notes/6.8/index.html#content-types-page-configuration-to-destination-mappings"><span>page configurations to specific Destinations</span></a><span>. This allowed users to publish their mobile page output, for example, to a different web server than their regular HTML page output. In 6.10, we&#8217;ve added a Web URL property to Destinations to help link to page outputs published to different web servers and consequently, different URLs.</span><br />
<span>&#160;</span><br />
<span>Let&#8217;s take Hannon Hill&#8217;s own marketing Site as an example. It has the Site URL:</span>&#160;<span>http://hannonhill.com</span><span>. Our services team recently created a</span>&#160;<a href="http://m.hannonhill.com/"><span>mobile version of the Site</span></a>&#160;<span>that publishes to</span>&#160;<a href="http://m.hannonhill.com/"><span>http://m.hannonhill.com</span></a><span>. With 6.10, we can set the Destination Web URL for our mobile Destination to be</span>&#160;<span>http://m.hannonhill.com</span>&#160;<span>so that it overrides the Sites&#8217; base URL.<br />
<br class="kix-line-break" />
</span></div>
<div ></div>
<div ></div>
<div><img alt="Destination Web URL property" height="331" src="http://hannonhill.com/news/blog/2011/destination-web-url.png" width="597" /><br />
<span>&#160;</span><br />
<span>That way, when we link to the mobile output of pages on our marketing, the link gets correctly written as http://m.hannonhill.com/&lt;path/to/page&gt;.html. Likewise, links from other Sites in Cascade to the mobile output of pages on the marketing site will use the Destination&#8217;s Web URL</span>&#160;<span>http://m.hannonhill.com</span>&#160;<span>instead of the Site URL.</span><br />
<br />
<h4 dir="ltr"><span>Other improvements</span></h4>
<span>&#160;</span><br />
<span>Other features include an upgrade to the syntax-highlighting file editor, an upgrade to the PDF engine, and support for Tomcat 6.

<div><span id="internal-source-marker_0.05350696831010282">Colleges and universities have started utilizing social networking tools in a variety of different ways. It&#8217;s important to maintain this kind of online presence&#8211;-allowing your content and yourselves to be accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week through a variety of different channels. It becomes imperative then to utilize social networking in a functional rather than dysfunctional way.</span><br />
<span>&#160;</span><br />
<span>Here are some tips and tricks for setting up a coherent social network:</span><br />
<span>&#160;</span><br />
<strong>Don&#8217;t be Intrusive/Invasive/Intolerable</strong> 
<ul>
<li><span>I hate to start off with a don&#8217;t, but it&#8217;s one of the more important rules of social networking. You don&#8217;t want to clog people&#8217;s feeds with information that doesn&#8217;t even apply to them. Think about the audience you&#8217;re reaching and how you can better serve them.</span> 
<ul>
<li><span>Utilize Twitter to post about emergencies (nuclear meltdown, perhaps), random campus occurrences (a squirrel army attacking all graduate students), or special events (free fried chicken giveaway)</span></li>
<li><span>Use Facebook to bring attention to long-running events and programs, like Spring commencement or study abroad and co-op deadlines</span></li>
<li><span>Incorporate LinkedIn by promoting alumni and current student networking events. Start discussions about different industries using campus faculty/staff</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Instead, provide a central location to consolidate and syndicate all of your social media interactions. Check out the recent</span>&#160;<a href="http://www.hannonhill.com/products/demos/union-college-webinar-video.html"><span>Union College webinar</span></a>&#160;<span>and how they implemented their Social Media Mash-Up network</span></li>
<li><span>Most importantly, know your audience for each Social Network. Don&#8217;t start discussions on LinkedIn that would be better handled by a Twitter account.<strong><em><span>&#160;</span></em></strong></span>&#160;Where's the fun in being redundant? Utilize LinkedIn for genuine connection between different individuals, stimulating conversations and random tidbits about other alums. Like - how many alumni own their own business? It can be a tool for so much more than just shameless promotion and networking.</li>
</ul>
<span ></span><br />
<strong>Interact!</strong> 
<ul>
<li><span>Put a face to your University! Your social media interactions define you as a University and it&#8217;s important to have a clear and confident voice in your presentation</span></li>
<li><span>Create special ways for your students to interact with you on-the-go. Almost everyone has a smart phone these days (thanks catchy advertisements) so syncing everything to be easily digestible on mobile devices is key--and helps extend your reach</span></li>
<li><span>Host live chats or Skype sessions with students to air grievances, comments and concerns. Take these seriously--being an accessible university means you take the good with the not-so-good</span></li>
<li><span>Share your content! Share your lectures and faculty with other colleges and universities. Creating a network of students, alumni and faculty from various institutions can really help make you a voice to be reckoned with</span></li>
<li><span>Never hesitate to respond to Tweets and Facebook comments. This encourages interaction with your followers and sets a precedent for the future</span></li>
</ul>
<span ></span><br />
<strong>Promote and Fundraise</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Networking is key.</strong></li>
<li><span>Promote social networking of alumni and more tenured faculty members with new students and new professors. Harness your ability to bring various groups of people together for the benefit of everyone</span></li>
<li><span>Showcase your students&#8217; talents on YouTube! Advocate for various professional organizations on your blog. Promote the hell out of an event for a student association--it all helps paint a clear picture of your university</span></li>
<li><span>Try out &#8220;Day in the Life&#8221; Twitter feeds. Have a live Twitter feed of various faculty members, students, and staff around campus showing what an average day for them is like</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Although Cascade Server 6.x has been out for over a year now, we still get questions about migrating to Sites. Since the list of advantages to using Sites grows with each release, we wanted to share some reasons why we think Sites are the way to go.</p>
<h4>Targets were Confusing</h4>
<p>Before Cascade Server 5.0, Targets were used to organize content and define a "website." Targets were both a relational and functional entity that defined the scope of a "site." The scope began with a selected folder and included all of the assets beneath it. During the content development process, a Target was to be chosen for every Template that was created. And as a limitation, each Template could only be used by one "site." With the Sites model, the idea of a Base Folder that stores a Site's content is a much more logical asset than a generic folder asset. And by having an asset in the CMS that is specifically designed for tracking what Site an object belongs to, you are able to freely share more assets, like Templates, across different Sites without needing to create multiple copies.</p>
<h4>Administration Area Asset Organization</h4>
<p>Depending on the size of your deployment, the lists of Asset Factories, Configuration Sets, Metadata Sets, Data Definitions, Content Types, etc. might be a bit lengthy. Couple this with systems that are not using Content Types at all and your System Administrators could have a wealth of assets to wade through every time they log in. Sites afford you the ability to create certain assets inside of each Site when they don't apply to any other. Because Administration Area assets can be shared across Sites, you won't need to worry about duplicating every asset in every Site either.</p>
<h4>Site-specific Publish Queue</h4>
<p>With the release of Cascade Server 6.8, publishing was greatly improved -- the Publish Queue concurrently process two jobs per Site now. This means that each Site is able to publish two jobs at a time and the system as a whole can process jobs from multiple Sites at the same time.</p>
<h4>Individual Recycle Bins</h4>
<p>As a temporary holding area for deleted assets, the Recycle Bin helps prevent the loss of content. All Home Area assets (Pages, Files, Folders, Blocks, Formats, Templates, and Links) are sent to the Recycle Bin before being permanently deleted. The real benefit comes when you couple this with a user's abilities within the system. These abilities dictate which assets they can see in a particular Recycle Bin and even which Recycle Bin a user can interact with in general. Users only interact with content they manage and content in other Sites remains safe from accidental changes by unknowing parties.</p>
<h4>Faster Database Queries</h4>
<p>The application arguably performs better when you make queries to the database using "site Ids" instead of having to query across all data in the database. Quick and easy.</p>
<h4>Site Roles</h4>
<p>Users can have elevated permissions in one Site and more restricted permissions in another Site. This concept is much, MUCH harder to reproduce in the Global Area. Take the ability to "Modify the Content Type of pages" as an example. If a User has this ability, they have it for all assets in the Global Area, whether they work with each "site" or not. In Sites, you determine what Roles you want available on that specific Site and then choose which Groups inherit those abilities. Users now "Modify the Content Type of pages" only in Sites to which the Groups they belong to are assigned.</p>
<h4>Simpler Access Rights</h4>
<p>Sites offer another level of granularity as to how you would like to manage the Users within each Site. They are great for decentralized environments where you may have different people managing different areas and groups of users. Each Site's available Role and Group assignments are separate and customizable. Furthermore, assigning access to content through Groups and changing end-level user account access is faster and more easily managed.</p>
<h4>Cross-Site Linking</h4>
<p>Cascade Server provides users with a number of different ways to manage links in content. Managed links are tracked within the system so that one is updated automatically when the linked-to asset moves or changes names. In Cascade 6.2, it is possible to create links in content to assets existing on different Sites. This is particularly useful when linking between pages on different Sites or when linking to centrally managed support assets like CSS and Javascript files.</p>
<p>This becomes impossible when you begin to publish assets that exist within the Global Area to different Destinations. Content that is contained within a Site has an extra element associated with it for tracking what Site the asset belongs to. This element is used in conjunction with publish information for each asset to allow Cascade Server to manage the links regardless of what server or domain the content is pushed to.</p>
<p>In addition to being able to link to assets that are maintained in different Sites, it is now possible to link to a specific Page Configuration, even if that Page asset is published to a different Destination. The Web URL field grants you the ability to cross-link assets that are published to different domain names while still managing those assets within one Site.</p>
<h4>Connectors</h4>
<p>This is an example of a Site-centric feature that is not available in the Global Area. Connectors are simply a means by which to (pardon the pun) "connect" third-party applications and tools with a Cascade Server instance. They allow users to take advantage of other applications, like WordPress, Facebook and Twitter, for pushing content that is managed within the system to external locations.</p>
<p>As you can see from this short list, migrating content into Sites provides a variety of benefits to the system itself and to the users. I would love to talk more in depth, about any of these points as well as points I may not have listed here, to anyone that wants to continue the discussion.</p></page-xhtml></div></div></div></div></div><div class="post"><div class="bg1"><div class="bg2"><div class="bg3"><h2 class="title">Sign Up For The Cascade Server 6.10 Webinar</h2><div class="entry"><page-xhtml><span>Wednesday, August 24th, 2011 at 1:00pm</span>&#160;--&#160;<span>Chris Armistead</span>
